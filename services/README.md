# Flavorly Services Architecture

## Overview

This directory contains the microservices that power the Flavorly platform. Each service is designed to be independently deployable, maintainable, and scalable, focusing on specific business domains within the application.

## Important Update: Migration to Supabase Edge Functions

After evaluation, we've decided to migrate our services to Supabase Edge Functions for:

1. Cost efficiency (500,000 invocations free per month)
2. Simplified deployment and maintenance
3. Automatic scaling
4. Better integration with Supabase infrastructure

### Migration Plan

Current services will be converted to Edge Functions following this structure:

```
/supabase/functions/
â”œâ”€â”€ waitlist-signup/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ waitlist-verify/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â””â”€â”€ waitlist-referral/
    â””â”€â”€ index.ts
```

### Key Changes

- Runtime: Moving from Node.js to Deno
- Structure: Single-file functions vs multi-file services
- Dependencies: URL imports vs npm packages
- Deployment: Supabase CLI vs traditional deployment

### Preserved Features

- All validation schemas
- Error handling patterns
- TypeScript types
- Response formats

## Services Structure

### Current Services

1. **Notification Service** (`/notification`)
   - Handles all platform notifications
   - Email, push notifications, in-app alerts

2. **Profile Service** (`/profile`)
   - User profile management
   - Preference settings
   - Account information

3. **Reservations Service** (`/reservations`)
   - Booking management
   - Scheduling
   - Availability tracking

4. **Search Service** (`/search`)
   - Search functionality
   - Filtering
   - Discovery features

5. **Waitlist Service** (`/waitlist`)
   - Waitlist management
   - User signup processing
   - Email verification
   - Referral tracking
   - Implemented endpoints:
     - POST /signup - Join waitlist
     - POST /verify - Verify email
     - POST /referral - Handle referrals

## Service Architecture Standards

### Directory Structure

Each service follows a consistent structure:

```
service-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controller.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ validation.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ service/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ service-name.service.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ service-name.types.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

Note: This structure will be replaced by Edge Functions structure after migration.

### Development Guidelines

1. **API Design**
   - RESTful endpoints
   - Consistent error handling
   - Input validation
   - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

2. **Service Independence**
   - Minimal cross-service dependencies
   - Service-specific databases when necessary
   - Independent deployment capability

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Minimum 80% code coverage

4. **Documentation**
   - Service-level README
   - API documentation
   - Setup instructions

## Infrastructure Integration

### Database

- Primary: Supabase
- Service-specific schemas
- Proper indexing for performance

### Authentication

- Centralized auth through Supabase
- Service-level authorization

### Monitoring

- Logging standards
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking

---

## Development Progress

### Completed

1. Initial service architecture setup
2. Waitlist service database schema
3. Basic service structure templates
4. Waitlist service implementation
   - Database schema
   - API endpoints
   - Input validation
   - Error handling
   - Supabase integration

### In Progress

1. Migration to Supabase Edge Functions
   - Converting waitlist service
   - Setting up new deployment process
   - Testing Edge Function performance

### Planned

1. Complete Edge Functions migration
2. Set up monitoring for Edge Functions
3. Document Edge Functions patterns
4. Migrate remaining services
